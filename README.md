# Github repositories:

Mobile application displaying a list of repositories, languages used, and amount of bites codded in each language for a specified user.<br />

# How to start:

In order to run the application one must download file Github_repositories.apk<br />

# Specification:

The application requires an Android version no lower than 7.0 (API 24)<br />
As of writing this description, 89% of all Android devices fit the requirement, which means that almost every device should be able to run the application.<br />
The project has been created with JDK 11, as it's been the newest LTS before the release of, still quite new, JDK 17.<br />

# Algorithm safety:

The algorithm can handle these exceptions:<br />
-invalid username<br />
-many pages of repositories on the user's profile<br />
-lack of repositories on the user's profile<br />

# Bonus features:

The application contains some features to make usage more comfortable:<br />
-hint what to write in the search view<br />
-after the search is done, searched username is displayed at the top of the screen<br />
-color pallet resembling that of a Github<br />

# Ideas for future development:

Some ideas I got for project development in future iterations:<br />
-adding the descriptions and creation dates for repositories<br />
-adding a profile picture of searched user<br />
-user authorization in order to allow a view of private repositories<br />
-adding colors for each language as on Github to make the application more visually appealing<br />
-adding a possibility of going to the Github website to inspect the repository thoroughly<br />
-search of repositories for a given user<br />
-hints during the search<br />

# Problems to solve:

Inaccessibility of java.net.http. and another post-Java 8 external, non-language features
